1) Keep the person calm and immobile to slow the spread of venom.
2) Remove any jewelry or tight clothing that could restrict circulation in case of swelling.
3) Keep the affected limb below heart level to reduce the flow of venom.
4) Find a wrap that's clean and dry. Cover the snakebite. If possible, tightly wrap a pressure bandage around the wound.
5) Do not attempt to suck out the venom, cut the bite area, or apply a tourniquet
