1) Remove the source of heat or flames and move the person away from danger.
2) Cool the burned area with cool (not cold) water for at least 10-20 minutes to reduce pain and swelling.
3) Cover the burn with a clean, dry, non-adhesive dressing or cloth to protect it from infection.
4) If the burn is severe, seek medical attention immediately.
5) If the person's clothing is stuck to the burn, do not try to remove it. Cut around the burned area and remove any loose clothing.
